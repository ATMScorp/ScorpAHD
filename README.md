### 📚 Research Process

The development of this system involved an in-depth research phase, where we evaluated various technologies for secure data management, role-based access control, and event management. We experimented with different frameworks and studied their performance in terms of security, scalability, and ease of integration.

A key part of the research was focused on implementing secure authentication and role management using **JWT tokens** for Admin and Student roles. Additionally, we explored methods for securely handling password changes to prevent unauthorized access.
